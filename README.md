In this project, i'm asked to break down the ticket and also refactor the code provided

my aim for the project, was to essentially understand how each block behaved and the expected result for the logic, to also pick out redundant code, and optimize performance





## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md)

## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)

If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:
1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS)
2. Run `npm i` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests
4. Run `npm start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing
